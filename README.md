## Introduction to CEM3396
The CEM3396 is a microprocessor controlled dual waveshaper with an integral VCF and VCA. It was manufactured in 1984 by Curtis Electromusic Specialities. As far as Google knows, it was only use in the following three synths:

## Synths that use the CEM3396
- Cheetah MS6
- Oberheim Matrix-6 & Matrix 6-R
- Oberheim Matrix-1000 (narrow version)
